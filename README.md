## Jeff's Personal Site

I haven't had the chance to create a project from scratch using a bunch of cool technologies at once in a while, so here I go.

I will be using the following:

```
npm
gulp
bower
sass
babel (for ES2015)
browsersync
d3 4.2.0
AngularJS 1.5.8
Angular Material 1.1 (For its sweet flex layout system)
```

## Building the site

You will need nodeJS & npm to build and host the site. Install as necessary with whichever package manager suits you and your OS.
Also, install [gulp](https://gulpjs.com) and [bower](https://bower.io).

Now, clone the project and run

```
npm install
bower install
```

This installs all of the project dependencies. Now, you can host the project locally, and check out the site on localhost:3000 from your browser.

```
gulp serve
```
