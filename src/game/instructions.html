	<h1>About the Game</h1>
	<p>This game supports 4+ players.</p>
	<p>
		There are 2 teams, red and blue, each with at least 2 people. Each team chooses their spy master, and the rest of the players are the spies.
	</p>
	<p>
		The spy masters job is to alert each of their allied spies to their field contacts, represented by their code name. Each word on the game board represents a code name of a field operative (blue or red), random citizen (grey), or assassin (black). 
	</p>
	<p>
		The goal of the game is to be the first team to contact all of your allied field operatives, while avoiding the assassin (the black tile).
	</p>

	<h1>How To Play</h1>
	<p>
		First, decide randomly who will be the red team, and who will be the blue team. The red team always goes first.
	</p>
	<p>
		The game consists of 25 cards with words on them in a 5-by-5 grid. The players can only see the words on the grid. The spy masters have additional information on the screen that only they can see, telling which card is on which team based on its position in the grid.
	</p>
	<p>
		A turn begins with the current team's spy master saying a word and a number. This word may not be a word that is on the board, or another form of a word on the board. The goal is for the spy master to communicate which words are on the allied team by creating a word association in their teammates' heads. For example, if two words on the board are "London" and "Moscow", the spy master might say "Cities 2". Be careful not to give clues that might steer your team to the other team's words, or the assassin.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the spy master has given the clue for the turn, it is up to the spies to select the correct words based on the associations they make with the clue. Players can discuss all they want with themselves, but the spy master can't say anything once they have given the clue, and they should keep a straight face throughout the turn. Players are, however, allowed to ask the spymaster to spell the word they were thinking of if they think it was part of the clue.
	</p>
	<p>
		Players tap the words that they think are the code names of their allies. When a card is tapped, it is revealed to everyone what team that word is on. If the players guessed a word that is on their team, they can continue guessing until they either:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Select a word that is not on their team (including grey)</li>
		<li>Select the assassin card, which causes their team to instantly lose the game</li>
		<li>Guess as many times as the number in the clue plus one. For example, if the clue was "Cities 2", the players get 3 guesses maximum</li>
		<li>Decide that they can't figure out any more words with the clue they have, and pass the turn to avoid accidentally picking the wrong words</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		A team wins when they correctly select all of the code names of their allies. Be careful, if you select the other team's allies, that will count towards their victory condition. If you are not sure about the clue, you can always stop guessing!
	</p>

	<h1>Strategy</h1>
	<p>
		Sometimes, your team will be far behind, and you will need to have some big rounds in order to win. If this is the case, your spy master may use a number that is higher than the actual number of words associated by their clue. For example, they might say "Cities 4" for "London" and "Moscow", but they want to give you more guesses in case your team was unsure about a previous clue, but the board has been revealed some more and now your team has a better idea of what they were talking about.
	</p>
	<p>
		Spy masters can't talk to their teams except for giving clues, but teams can think out loud as much as they want. They can say which words they are thinking about, and if the spy master notices that they are way off track, they can try to give more a more focused clue on the next turn.
